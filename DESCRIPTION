Title: Cached Read
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Or Gadish
Maintainer: Or Gadish <orgadish@gmail.com>
Description: 
    The main functions in this package are `with_cache` and `cached_read`. The former is a simple way to cache
    an R object into a file on disk, using `cachem`. The latter is a wrapper around any standard read function, 
    but caches both the output *and* the file list info. If the input file list info hasn't changed, the cache is used;
    otherwise, the original files are re-read. This can save time if the original operation requires
    reading from many files, and/or involves lots of processing.
