Title: Cached Read
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Or Gadish
Maintainer: Or Gadish <orgadish@gmail.com>
Description: 
    The main function in this package is `cached_read`. It is a wrapper around a standard read function, 
    which saves the output into a local file. If the input files haven't changed, the next time the read
    is performed, the cached file will be read. This can save time if the original operation requires
    reading from many files, or involves lots of processing.
